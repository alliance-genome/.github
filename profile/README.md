# What is the Alliance of Genome Resources?
A consortium of 7 model organism databases (MODs) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium whose goal is to provide an integrated view of their data to all biologists, clinicians and other interested parties.

The primary mission of the Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance) is to develop and maintain sustainable genome information resources that facilitate the use of diverse model organisms in understanding the genetic and genomic basis of human biology, health and disease. This understanding is fundamental for advancing genome biology research and for translating human genome data into clinical utility.
